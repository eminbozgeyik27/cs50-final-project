# CS50x Final Project: Python Virtual Oscilloscope

## 🎯 Overview

This is a Python-based virtual oscilloscope simulation that allows users to generate and visualize three types of waveforms: **sine**, **square**, and **triangle**. The application displays real-time plots using `matplotlib`, calculates RMS and Vpp values, allows the selection of time units (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds), and exports waveform data to CSV.

## 💡 How i chose this project's topic

I chose to build a digital oscilloscope as my final project because it combines my interests in electronics, signal processing, and software development. As an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student, I often work with waveforms and measurement tools. By creating a digital oscilloscope using Python, I was able to bridge the gap between hardware concepts and software implementation.

This project allowed me to simulate signal behaviors (like sine, square, and triangle waves), calculate important electrical values such as RMS and Vpp, and visualize them in real time using Matplotlib. It also helped me improve my skills in GUI design, data visualization, and interactive programming.

## 🧠 What Does It Do?

- Real-time signal generation and visualization.
- Dynamic control of frequency and amplitude.
- Selection of waveform type and time unit.
- Live display of **RMS** (Root Mean Square) and **Vpp** (Peak-to-Peak Voltage).
- Export of generated waveform data to `.csv`.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📊 **Waveform Selection:** Sine, Square, Triangle
- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls:** Frequency, Amplitude, Time Unit
- 🧮 **Live Metrics:** RMS and Vpp auto-calculated
- 💾 **Data Export:** Save waveform to CSV with one click
- 🖼️ **Matplotlib Interface:** Uses built-in widgets like `TextBox`, `RadioButtons`, and `Button`
