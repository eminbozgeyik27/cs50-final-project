# CS50x Final Project: Python Virtual Oscilloscope

## 🎯 Overview

This is a Python-based virtual oscilloscope simulation that allows users to generate and visualize three types of waveforms: **sine**, **square**, and **triangle**. The application displays real-time plots using `matplotlib`, calculates RMS and Vpp values, allows the selection of time units (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds), and exports waveform data to CSV.

## 🧠 What Does It Do?

- Real-time signal generation and visualization.
- Dynamic control of frequency and amplitude.
- Selection of waveform type and time unit.
- Live display of **RMS** (Root Mean Square) and **Vpp** (Peak-to-Peak Voltage).
- Export of generated waveform data to `.csv`.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📊 **Waveform Selection:** Sine, Square, Triangle
- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls:** Frequency, Amplitude, Time Unit
- 🧮 **Live Metrics:** RMS and Vpp auto-calculated
- 💾 **Data Export:** Save waveform to CSV with one click
- 🖼️ **Matplotlib Interface:** Uses built-in widgets like `TextBox`, `RadioButtons`, and `Button`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Important !!! Run the Program**
        python [filename.py]
